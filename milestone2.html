<h1><u>childrens day celebrations</u></h1>
<p><big><i>Children's Day is a commemorative date celebrated annually in honor of children, whose date of observance varies by country. In 1925, International Children's Day was first proclaimed in Geneva during the World Conference on Child Welfare. Since 1950, it is celebrated on June 1 in most Communist and post-Communist countries.[1] World Children's Day is celebrated on the 20th November to commemorate the Declaration of the Rights of the Child by the UN General Assembly on 20 November 1959.[2] In some countries, it is Children's Week and not Children's Day.</i></big></p>
<p><b>Before 1964, India celebrated Children's Day on November 20 (the United Nations observes it on this day.) However, after the death of Pandit Nehru in 1964, it was decided that his birthday be celebrated as Children's Day.
 
Along with being an able administrator, Nehru enforced the establishment of some of the most prominent educational institutions in India. His vision led to the establishment of AIIMS, IIT and IIM.
 
Nehru has left behind a legacy of education for the children of India. 
 
He once said, "The children of today will make the India of tomorrow. The way we bring them up will determine the future of the country." </b></p>
